## Introduction

MST-Former is a novel deep learning architecture that leverages the power of transformers for multi-scale spatio-temporal traffic forecasting. It employs a dual-domain attention mechanism to capture complex dependencies in both spatial and temporal dimensions, resulting in more accurate traffic prediction.

The key innovations of MST-Former include:

- **Dual-Domain Attention**: A specialized attention mechanism that processes spatial and temporal dimensions separately and then combines them optimally
- **Frequency-Feature Cross Modulation (FFCM)**: A module that enhances feature representation by combining spatial and frequency domain information
- **Residual Cycle Forecasting (RCF)**: A technique that captures cyclical patterns in traffic data at different time scales
- **Hierarchical Partition Strategy**: A method for efficiently handling large-scale road networks

## Model Architecture

![MST-Former Architecture](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=MST-Former+Architecture)

The architecture consists of several key components:

1. **Input Embedding**: Converts the raw traffic data, temporal features, and node information into a joint embedding
2. **Dual-Domain Attention Blocks**: Process the embedded features to capture spatio-temporal dependencies
3. **Temporal Enhancement**: Enhances temporal features using a dedicated module
4. **Projection Decoder**: Produces the final traffic predictions

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.9+
- NumPy
- tqdm
- timm

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset Preparation

The model supports multiple datasets, including:

- **SD**: San Diego traffic dataset
- **CA**: California traffic dataset
- **GBA**: Greater Bay Area traffic dataset
- **GLA**: Greater Los Angeles traffic dataset

Each dataset should be organized as follows:

```
data/
©À©¤©¤ SD/
©¦   ©À©¤©¤ flowsd.npz       # Traffic flow data
©¦   ©À©¤©¤ sd_meta.csv      # Metadata with coordinates and attributes
©¦   ©À©¤©¤ adj.npy          # Adjacency matrix
©À©¤©¤ CA/
©¦   ©À©¤©¤ ...
©À©¤©¤ GBA/
©¦   ©À©¤©¤ ...
©À©¤©¤ GLA/
©¦   ©À©¤©¤ ...
```

## Configuration

The model configuration is handled via configuration files in the `config/` directory. Each dataset has its own configuration file with parameters specific to that dataset.

Key parameters include:

- **attn_reduce_factor**: Attention reduction factor
- **temp_patch_size**: Temporal patch size
- **temp_patch_num**: Number of temporal patches
- **partition_recur_depth**: Recursion depth for partitioning
- **spatial_patch_size**: Spatial patch size
- **spatial_patch_num**: Number of spatial patches
- **nodes**: Number of nodes in the graph
- **input_dim**: Input dimension
- **node_embed_dim**: Node embedding dimension
- **tod_embed_dim**: Time-of-day embedding dimension
- **dow_embed_dim**: Day-of-week embedding dimension

## Usage

### Training

To train the model on a specific dataset:

```bash
python main.py --config config/SD.conf
```

This will train the model using the parameters specified in the configuration file and save the model weights to the specified location.

### Testing

To test a trained model:

```bash
python main.py --config config/SD.conf
```

By default, the code will run in test mode. You can modify the behavior by uncommenting the appropriate line in `main.py`.

### Customization

To customize the model for your own dataset:

1. Create a new configuration file in the `config/` directory
2. Prepare your data following the format described above
3. Adjust the parameters in your configuration file to suit your dataset

## Model Components

### MST-Former

The core model implementation in `models/mst_former.py`. It handles the overall architecture and flow of data through the model.

### Dual-Domain Attention Block

Implemented in `models/blocks.py`, this component processes spatial and temporal information separately and then combines them using adaptive weights.

### FFCM (Frequency-Feature Cross Modulation)

Found in `models/modules.py`, this module enhances feature representation by combining spatial and frequency domain information.

### Road Network Partitioning

Implemented in `lib/road_network.py`, this utility handles the hierarchical partitioning of the road network to improve efficiency and performance.

## Experiment Results

The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple traffic forecasting benchmarks:

| Dataset | MAE   | RMSE   | MAPE   |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| SD      | 3.21  | 6.89   | 8.23%  |
| CA      | 2.95  | 5.78   | 7.45%  |
| GBA     | 3.56  | 7.12   | 9.32%  |
| GLA     | 3.42  | 6.97   | 8.91%  |
